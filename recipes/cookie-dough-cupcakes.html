        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk flour, baking soda, and sea salt in a bowl. Beat butter,
                white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a
                separate bowl until smooth. Add 1 egg and vanilla extract and
                beat until smooth. Mix in the flour mixture from earlier. Place
                in some chocolate chips and mix. Form the dough into small balls.
                Place on a baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>
                Lightly beat 3 eggs in a bowl with electric mixer. Add cake mix, water,
                and canola oil. Continue beating with mixer for 2 minutes. Spoon into
                prepared cupcake liners, filling each 2/3 full. Place a frozen
                cookie ball into each cupcake.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake portion
                comes clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before
                removing to cool on a plate.
